#To Do 

- Make PEAQ class that sits on top of everything
	- I don't think we should set this part up like Kabal does, I don't think it's a good use of time and it probably won't serve us long term. 
	- The class needs to do things like: take in arrays of audio, slice into frames, determine starting and ending points...
	- I don't think I want it to take in wav's like Kabal's function does. 
	- Run our other class PQeval
	- I'm not I want to use the same iterative, structure based method Kabal does, I much prefer the idea of time/frequency matrices for the variables. We may run into some issues with theis approach, but I think it's worth considering.

###Research Question: How do we measure how similar two signals sound?

Introduction
	Quantifying human perceptions of physical phenomena is a complex task that covers various disciplines. Speech and image recognition are relatively mature fields that have seen particular progress in the last few years through training deep neural networks on large labeled datasets. Notably for both speech and image recognition, hand-engineered features such as SIFT and MFCC are quickly being replaced by learned features. It is difficult to say if the deep learning paradigm will replace, augment, or provide more insight into other relevant fields concerned with quantifying the perception of sounds. We believe relevant work can be divided broadly into the following areas: Audio Compression and Perceptual Coding, Music Information Retrieval, Machine Learning, and Measures of Audio Quality.
